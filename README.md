glitcheer
=========

Processing sketch that glitches images and creates glitch-like patterns and stuff.

The glitcher class is Glitcheer.pde. It's run from the main.pde so that the class can keep the proper, fancy name.
Blame Processing for requiring the folder's name to be the same as the sketch's entry point.
